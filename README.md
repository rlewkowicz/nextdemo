The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate basic capacity with some of the technologies described in the nextdoor engineering blog (engblog.nextdoor.com). The goal here is architectural understanding, not necessarily code or systems quality.

Please keep in mind I scrapped this together in 3 days on top of other interviews. 

1/31 - I'm a little behind. I use flux normally and decided to go with argo because that's the popular git model. Install has been a bit of a pain. The goal is to demonstrate tf hand off to git ops which will install istio/envoy and django. From there idk if I'll do basic site vars or do istio envoy/okta I think it was. That needs cross plane for dynamo etc.
